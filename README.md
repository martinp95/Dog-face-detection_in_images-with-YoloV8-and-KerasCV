# Dog Face Detection in Images with YoloV8 and KerasCV
This repository demonstrates how to implement **object detection** using the YOLOv8 model with KerasCV to detect dog faces in images. The project leverages a pre-trained YOLO model to accurately detect and localize dog faces, a task that falls under the category of object detection.

The dataset used for training and testing comes from [Dog Face Detection (YOLO Format)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wutheringwang/dog-face-detectionyolo-format), which contains labeled images specifically tailored for identifying dog faces. The model has been fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting dog faces across a variety of images.

## Key Features:
- **YOLOv8 for Object Detection**: Utilizes the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect dog faces in real-time, offering fast and accurate results.
- **KerasCV**: KerasCV is a repository of modular building blocks (layers, metrics, losses, data-augmentation) that applied computer vision engineers can leverage to quickly assemble production-grade, state-of-the-art training and inference pipelines for common use cases such as image classification, object detection, image segmentation, image data augmentation, etc.
- **Pretrained Model**: Starts with a pretrained YOLOv8 model to speed up training and enhance accuracy, taking advantage of the robust object detection capabilities of YOLO.

This project demonstrates the power of combining **YOLOv8's object detection capabilities** with **KerasCV**, enabling efficient and accurate detection of dog faces in images.
