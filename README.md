# Dog-face-detection_in_images-with-YoloV8-and-KerasCV
This repository demonstrates how to implement object detection using the YOLOv8 model with KerasCV to detect dog faces in images. The project leverages a pre-trained YOLO model to accurately detect and localize dog faces, a task that falls under the category of object detection.
